My Farm Project:
A project using HTML5 canvas element and basic JS in order to simulate a relaxing farm

## See my WIP project: https://cofarmsim.netlify.app/

How it's Made:
Basic JS modules with an HTML5 canvas element. Following principles of OOP to add in flora and fauna you'd regularly see on a farmscape.
project is designed to push abilities to randomize movement patterns and speeds while alone but to have different interactions when certain other objects are present. WIP

Optimizations:
-randomize cow object's grazing pattern
-cow to 'chase' grass as it randomly generates/grows
-add more flora/random generations and corresponding animals to 'meet up'
  -bee & flower
  -cat & mouse
  
  Lessons Learned:
  -better understanding of the benefits to OOP especially the benefit to abstraction and separating classes for tweaking
